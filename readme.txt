This repository preserves one of the earliest self-hosted C compilers.

While the exact origin cannot be fully verified, the structure, style, and
implementation patterns correspond closely to the compiler developed by
Dennis M. Ritchie and Bell Laboratories around 1973.

It stands as both a historical and educational artifact, offering a direct
glimpse into the formative years of the C language and early UNIX systems.

A tribute to Dennis Ritchie, whose work continues to shape the foundations
of modern computing, and to the enduring simplicity of the original UNIX design.

This repository is a preservation mirror of the now-deleted GitHub project
'mortdeus/legacy-cc', which was included in the GitHub Arctic Code Vault
Archive Program for historical preservation.
